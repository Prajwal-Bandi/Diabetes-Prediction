# Diabetes Prediction System 🩺🤖

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Diabetes Prediction System** designed to assess the risk of diabetes in individuals using key health indicators. The system aims to aid in early detection and intervention, offering actionable insights that contribute to improved healthcare outcomes.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Diabetes Prediction System uses machine learning algorithms to evaluate the likelihood of an individual being diabetic based on inputs such as:

- Age  
- Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- Blood Pressure  
- Insulin Levels  
- Glucose Levels  
- Family History of Diabetes  

Users can enter their health metrics through a user-friendly interface to get a real-time diabetes risk assessment.
